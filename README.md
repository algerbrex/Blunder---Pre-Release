Blunder is a chess engine that is a work in progress. Currently it implements a negamax search algorithm,
with alpha-beta pruning, a transposition table, iterative deepening, move ordering, quiesence search and
a basic opening book. A working binary compiled on a linux machine is included. To compile the code yourself,
download golang and run "go build in blunder/blunder".
